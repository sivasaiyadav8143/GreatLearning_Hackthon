# GreatLearning_Hackthon
A Global Hackthon on Great Stone Rating. Secured 2nd Position in the competition.

Objective :  The goal of this hackathon is to predict
GreatStone’s rating of a mutual fund. In order to help
investors decide on which mutual fund to pick for an
investment, the task is to build a model that can predict the
rating of a mutual fund. The various attributes that define a
mutual fund can be used for building the model.

1. Created a data model to predict GreatStone’s rating of a mutual fund.
2. Performed EDA, Data wangling(data merging, dealing NA's &outlier etc), Class Imbalance, Feature Selection and Dimensionality Reduction while Performing the ML algorithm.
3. Performed Feature Engineering with some domain knowledge to improve the model accuracy.
